# Ingredient Saving Recipe App

-Have you ever gone to the grocery store with great intentions, bought a fridge full of things, and then a watch all of that great produce turn into a science experiment in your fridge in a week or so?

-If you have, you are not alone

-We all want to eat healthy and shopping for food and preparing it for ourselves often represents the greatest oppurtunity at a healthy diet. 

-But what happens when we don't know how to make these groceries, what will we do then?! It almost seems inevitable that our food will expire now, whatever will we do!?

-Well for this reason we developed this Ingredient Saving Recipe App! We have created an app that allows you to search fresh produce that you may currently possess and you will instantly recieve a hnadful of recipes that incorporate that item, what other items might be needed for the dish, and how it is best prepared!

Our team was comprised: Alexander Tsiklidis, Erick Tolentino, and James Edmond
